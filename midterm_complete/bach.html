			<h2>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750)</h2>
			<p>Johann Sebastian Bach is now regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, although he was not nearly as famous as some of his contemporaries such as 
			Handel in his lifetime. Nevertheless, Bach was a natural improviser on the organ and keyboard, a skilled violinist, and a prolific composer in almost every major 
			genre of his day. Bach came from a large family of musicians and some of his children went on to become notable composers including Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach and 
			Johann Christian Bach. J.S. Bachâ€™s compositional focus changed based on the different positions he held throughout his life in different cities throughout Germany. 
			Despite the lack of recognition during his lifetime, Bach's legacy endures, his body of work encompassing the full breadth of human emotion and technical mastery. 
			His contributions to instrumental, keyboard, and sacred music genres have established him as a seminal figure whose influence reverberates through the ages.</p>

			<h2>Instrumental Music</h2>
				<p>The Six Brandenburg Concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach are a collection of Baroque instrumental works presented to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of 
				Brandenburg-Schwedt, in 1721. Each concerto showcases various groupings of solo instruments, highlighting Bach's innovative approach to texture and 
				concertino (solo group) vs. ripieno (full ensemble) contrasts. The Third Concerto in G Major, BWV 1048, shown here, is particularly notable for its energetic and 
				rhythmic string ensemble, consisting of three violins, three violas, three cellos, and basso continuo. This concerto is admired for its virtuosic interplay 
				among the strings and its structurally unique two fast movements, with a brief second movement often improvised by performers.</p>

			<h2>Keyboard Music</h2>
				<p>
				The Well-Tempered Clavier, composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, is a collection of preludes and fugues covering all 24 major and minor keys, 
				showcasing the capabilities of the well-tempered tuning system, a precursor to modern equal temperament that allowed for music to be played in tune 
				in all keys, a groundbreaking concept at the time. Bach's exploration across these keys was unusual for his era, aiming to demonstrate the musical 
				and technical possibilities of this tuning system. The Prelude and Fugue in B-flat Major from Book 1 (BWV 866) epitomizes Bach's blend of technical 
				prowess and musicality, with the prelude offering a lively, flowing melody and the fugue presenting a masterful exercise in three-voice counterpoint. 
				This piece serves as a vivid example of Bach's genius in marrying structure and expression within his keyboard compositions.</p>

			<h2>Sacred Music</h2>
				<p>Johann Sebastian Bach's vocal music spans a wide range of religious and secular works, including cantatas, motets, masses, and passions, distinguished 
				by their intricate counterpoint and profound expressiveness. Among these, the Mass in B Minor stands as a monumental achievement, encapsulating Bach's mastery 
				over vocal composition and his deep spiritual and musical insights. The Gloria section of the Mass in B Minor is celebrated for its vibrant energy and complex 
				structure, featuring a series of choruses and solos that proclaim joy and exultation. This section showcases Bach's ability to weave together diverse vocal and 
				instrumental textures, creating a rich tapestry of sound that elevates the liturgical text to new heights of artistic expression.</p>
