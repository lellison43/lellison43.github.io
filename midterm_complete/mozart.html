			<h2>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 - 1791)</h2>
			<p>
			Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born in Salzburg Germany in 1756, was a musical prodigy who began composing at the young age of five and achieved fame across Europe 
			for his extraordinary talents as both a composer and a performer by his teenage years. His life, marked by an astonishing output of over 600 works despite 
			his early death at 35, is a testament to his genius and relentless creativity. Mozart's life was filled with remarkable anecdotes, such as the legendary 
			completion of the overture to his opera "Don Giovanni" in a single day, a testament to his ability to work under pressure and his notorious habit of procrastination. 
			Despite his profound influence on Western music and being one of the most prolific composers of the classical era, Mozart died under mysterious circumstances, 
			was buried in a common grave without ceremony, reflecting the fleeting nature of fame and the stark realities of 18th-century life. His legacy, however, has 
			endured, making him one of the most celebrated and influential composers in the history of Western music.</p>

			<h2>Symphonic Music</h2>
				<p>Mozart's symphonic oeuvre, consisting of 41 symphonies, is a cornerstone of the classical repertoire, celebrated for its emotional depth, innovative 
				orchestration, and architectural precision. These works mark the evolution of the symphony from its early classical form into a vehicle for profound expression, 
				showcasing Mozart's mastery of harmonic language and thematic development. His symphonies are known for their melodic richness, dynamic contrasts, and the seamless 
				integration of various musical ideas within a cohesive structure. The Symphony No. 35 in D major, K. 385, known as the "Haffner Symphony," exemplifies Mozart's

			<h2>Opera</h2>
				<p>Mozart's operatic compositions, including masterpieces such as "The Marriage of Figaro," "Don Giovanni," and "Cos√¨ fan tutte," stand at the pinnacle of 
				the opera repertoire, celebrated for their intricate character development, profound emotional depth, and exquisite musicality. His operas seamlessly blend 
				dramatic narrative, expressive arias, and complex ensembles, reflecting both the complexities of human nature and the societal norms of his time. Among these, 
				"The Magic Flute" is particularly renowned for its allegorical richness, combining elements of fairy tale, Masonic symbolism, and Enlightenment ideals within a 
				captivating musical framework. The opera's "Queen of the Night" aria is one of the most virtuosic pieces in the soprano repertoire, showcasing Mozart's ability 
				to convey intense emotion and character through challenging vocal fireworks, symbolizing both the Queen's fury and her desperation, and highlighting Mozart's 
				genius in operatic composition.</p>
